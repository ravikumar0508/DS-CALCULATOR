Key Features:

User Interface:
Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input mathematical expressions and view results.
The interface should support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Expression Parsing:
Implement an expression parser to tokenize and parse mathematical expressions entered by the user.
Use data structures such as stacks or queues to handle operator precedence and associativity.
Operand and Operator Handling:
Design data structures to store operands and operators and perform calculations.
Utilize stacks or queues to handle operator precedence and evaluate expressions efficiently.
Memory Management:
Implement memory management techniques to handle large numbers or floating-point precision.
Utilize dynamic memory allocation or custom data structures to store and manipulate numerical values.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling mechanisms to detect and handle invalid inputs or mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero).
Provide informative error messages to guide users in correcting input mistakes.
Performance Optimization:
Optimize algorithms and data structures to minimize time and space complexity for arithmetic operations.
Utilize techniques such as memoization or algorithmic optimizations to improve performance.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: C++, Java, Python, or any language supporting data structures
User Interface: Console-based interface or graphical user interface (GUI) using frameworks like Tkinter (Python), JavaFX (Java), or Qt (C++)
Development Environment: IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA
Version Control: Git for code management and collaboration
